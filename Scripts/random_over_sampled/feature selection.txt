Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) // same across all the algorithm
Chi-Square Test // same across all the algorithm
Forward Selection  // different as it contains for loop enclosed with the algorithm
Backward Elimination
LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) // different for all the algorithm
Tree-based Methods (e.g., Random Forest)
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
(optional)//SelectKBest (from scikit-learn)


above given is the code for referance and now write the one same as the above for "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)" as feature selection method and also write the complete code with the above mentioned evaluation parameters

FN(flase negative) can be compromised
